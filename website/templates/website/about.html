        My name is Alessandra Wong (she/her) and I'm currently a post-bac student looking to get my second bachelor's in Computer Science.

        This year, I'm working on finishing my degree with Portland State University, and I'm currently working with my Capstone team on a project for PSUâ€™s <a href="https://trec.pdx.edu">Transportation and Research Center</a>. The project involves creating a user interface for the BikePed Portal, a database for non-motorized transportation data collection that is used by local and national transportation organizations.

        Previously, I was a research assistant in the Human Factors and Applied Cognition Research Labs at George Mason University, which focuses on how people interact with computers and other forms of technology. Going forward in my CS career, I'd love to be involved with designing or working on applications focused on the user experience!
