  <h2>Project 1: Instant Messaging App</h2>
  <p>
    My first hands-on introduction to the development process was a web-based messaging app for PSU's Elements of Software Engineering class in 2021. The goal of the project was to have a working browser-based chat system which could facilitate communication between at least two logged-in users, implemented using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node). By the end of the quarter, I had a pretty rough working example of the app, with the ability to demonstrate messaging across two instances. However, along with many other features, the user functionality was never implemented, despite there being a user creation form.

  <h2>Project 2: Django-Based Blog Demo</h2>
  <p>
    Another project I worked on was a simple blog based on the Django
    framework. The blog was created following a tutorial by
    <a href="https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/">Django Girls</a>. Django is
    a web framework based off of Python, which is an alternative to the
    JavaScript-based frameworks that are commonly in use, including Node.
